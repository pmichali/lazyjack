TODOS/FUTURES (in no particular order):
- Decide how to handle failures on prepare. Exit? Rollback or rely on clean?
- Up & Down implementation.
- Re-enable static route creation/deletion to pods, during the up/down phase.
- Move bridge plugin CNI config to up/down phase, as file gets wiped when "kubeadm reset" run.
- Do we need to restart kubelet before kubeadm init? Need to reload daemon.
- Validation of docker version. Kubernetes? Kubeadm, kubelet, kubectl. Go version. Any other tools required?
- Check IP addresses, subnets, CIDRs in config to see if they are valid.
- Check pod net prefix and mask compatible (former should specify size - 16 bits).
- Check that node ID > 0? 1?
- Ensure no overlap on pod, support, mgmt subnets.
- Check that NAT IP within NAT subnet, and that NAT subnet withing support subnet.
- Mocking of netlink library and docker for better code coverage.
- Figure out how to do join on minions - need token.
- Support Calico plugin vs Bridge. Cillium? Others?
- Do Istio startup. Useful?  Metal LB startup?
- If needed/desired, see if can run DNS64 and NAT64 on separate hosts. Are routes correct?
- Try this with IPv4 settings? Useful?
- Should we support hypervisors other than Docker (have separated out the code)?
- Add per function documentation.
- Check coverage, gofmt, refactor.
- Add version command
- Create makefile for building/installing. Build executable for immediate use?
- Blog on tool: prerequisites, dependencies (tayga/bind9, go packages, versions) how to create config file, usage, TODOs/Futures.
- Try modifying DNS64/NAT64 to use IPv6 addresses for sites that support it, rather than using synthesized IPv4 address.
- Allow configuration file to be specified as URL?
- In config file use CIDRs for subnets and split them out to use the parts in the app, instead of having the user specify a subnet and a size separately.
- Need to rename app, so as to not conflict with other project names (e.g. spinnaker/orca).
- Consider using Kubeadm's DynamicKubeletConfig, instead of drop-in file for kubelet.
